Microprocessor (ET3300) + AI and Intelligent Applications (ET4245)


This project demonstrates a fruit recognition system designed to enhance store automation. Using advanced AI models for object detection and classification, the system identifies various fruits in real-time. After training the AI model, it is deployed on an ESP32-CAM microcontroller for efficient, low-power operation.

### **Project Overview**

Modern retail environments increasingly rely on automation to improve efficiency and customer experience. Our solution focuses on building a compact and intelligent device to recognize fruits in stores. The system is particularly useful for self-checkout kiosks or inventory management systems.

### **Features**

- Real-time fruit detection and classification
- Low-power, cost-effective deployment using ESP32-CAM
- Lightweight AI model optimized for embedded systems
- Easy integration with existing store infrastructure

### **Technical Workflow**

1. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Collect images of various fruits under different lighting conditions and angles.
   - Label the images with appropriate annotations using tools like LabelImg.

2. **Model Training**
   - Use a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNet, YOLO, or TensorFlow Lite models).
   - Train the model on the prepared dataset.
   - Optimize the model for deployment by converting it into TensorFlow Lite or another lightweight format suitable for ESP32.

3. **ESP32-CAM Deployment**
   - Flash the trained AI model onto the ESP32-CAM.
   - Write a firmware program to process camera input and perform inference using the AI model.
   - Integrate Wi-Fi capabilities for sending recognition results to a central server or display device.

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test the system with a diverse set of fruit images to ensure accuracy.
   - Validate performance under different conditions (e.g., lighting, occlusions).

### **Hardware Requirements**

- **ESP32-CAM Module**: A low-cost microcontroller with built-in camera support.
- **Power Supply**: 5V source.
- **Fruits**: For testing and demonstration purposes.

### **Software Requirements**

- **Python**: For data preprocessing and model training.
- **TensorFlow or PyTorch**: For AI model development.
- **Arduino IDE**: For programming the ESP32-CAM.
- **Edge Impulse or TFLite Micro**: For model optimization and deployment.
